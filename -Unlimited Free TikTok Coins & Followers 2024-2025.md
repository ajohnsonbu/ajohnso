## What are TikTok coins?  
To put it rightly, having money in your bank account may seem enough, but TikTok coins definitely wonâ€™t. Just like every app has its trademarked currency, so does this one. The in-app currency is paid for with real money. You can purchase virtual gifts to appreciate any content creatorâ€™s work or return a favor. If you are in alignment with the concept of â€˜twitch tipping,â€™ you ought to enjoy the exchange of gestures.  
<br><br>

Interestingly, you can buy a gift for your preferred performer and show love in ways you like. You could also trade these coins for diamonds, which in turn can be exchanged for actual cash. A clever way to make some side money, isnâ€™t it? In the real sense, TikTok coins let you have fun and monetize to a certain extent.

## How to buy TikTok coins?  
I know you are an eager beaver, so letâ€™s start with the basics. Itâ€™s no rocket science. Hereâ€™s a simple guide on how to buy TikTok coins.  
These coins can be bought only within the app, which is a no-brainer. The value of the coins may fluctuate depending on the exchange rate. As an underpinning, about 100 coins should cost $1. And you can buy up to 10,000 coins at a time. For example, 5000 TikTok coins will cost you about $66.99, and 7000 coins will cost about $129.99. Simply follow these eight-step procedures:  
<br><br>

1. Open the app on your device, head to the lower menu, and tap on "Me" (your profile).  
2. You will spot the ellipsis (three dots) on the top-most right corner. Tap on it.  
3. Once there, select the "Balance" option, which should be the fourth option.  
4. You will find the "Recharge" option.  
5. Multiple price options will appear for convenience.  
6. At the time of payment, you will get a couple of alternatives to choose from. If your Google Pay or Apple Pay is already activated, itâ€™s even easier. Alternatively, you can pay with your credit card.  
7. You will most likely get notified after the transaction.  
8. Check your TikTok coin balance, and you're ready to roll.

## How can I get free TikTok coins?  
The methods for getting free Coins on TikTok are not guaranteed and may vary in their success. TikTok relies on the sale of Coins to generate revenue, so providing them for free is not a common occurrence.  
<br><br>

While some users have reported success with certain methods to obtain free Coins, itâ€™s essential to exercise caution as the outcome is not guaranteed. TikTokâ€™s policies and promotions may change over time, and what worked for some users in the past might not work for others now.
